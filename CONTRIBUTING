## Publishing

Publishing new versions is automatically handled by GitHub actions for versions tagged with `x.y.z[.prerelease]` (`1.2.3`, `1.2.3.rc1`, etc.). If you are a maintainer, you can create a new release by following these steps:

1. Switch to the `master` branch:

```bash
git checkout master
```

2. Create a new tag:

```bash
git tag 1.2.3
```

3. Push the tag to the upstream repository:

```bash
git push upstream 1.2.3
```

To push a tag together with a new commit:

```bash
git push upstream master --tags
```
