## Publishing

Publishing new versions is automatically handled by GitHub actions for versions tagged with `mreg-cli-v*` (e.g. `mreg-cli-v1.0.0`). If you are a maintainer, you can create a new release by following these steps:

1. Switch to the `master` branch:

```bash
git checkout master
```

2. Create a new tag:

```bash
git tag mreg-cli-v1.2.3
```

3. Push the tag to the upstream repository:

```bash
git push upstream mreg-cli-v1.2.3
```
